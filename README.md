# bitburner-scripts
A repository of scripts I wrote for the game [Bitburner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/). The documentation for the game can be found [here](https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (It's highly recommended to read the documentation when learning the game as it has a bunch of useful information)

## Purpose
This repository is meant to hold all the scripts I wrote for the game. This is kinda like a public journal to document the learning process as I learn more about the game and Netscript (also if you play the game, aren't that great at coding and just need a solution to a problem you're currently having, I might have a script or two that can help you out)
